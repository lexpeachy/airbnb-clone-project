GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

üîê API Security
Securing backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the platform. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented in this project:

‚úÖ Authentication
What: Verifies the identity of users via secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens).

Why it matters: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints, preventing impersonation or data leaks.

‚úÖ Authorization
What: Controls access based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host).

Why it matters: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they don‚Äôt own (e.g., a guest trying to modify someone else‚Äôs property listing).

‚úÖ Rate Limiting
What: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a certain timeframe.

Why it matters: Protects against brute-force attacks, abuse, and server overload.

‚úÖ Input Validation & Sanitization
What: Ensures all user input is checked and cleaned before processing.

Why it matters: Prevents injection attacks like SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

‚úÖ HTTPS / Secure Communication
What: Enforces secure, encrypted connections between clients and servers.

Why it matters: Prevents data interception during transmission, especially sensitive information like login credentials and payment data.

‚úÖ Secure Payments
What: Uses third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with PCI-compliant practices.

Why it matters: Ensures financial transactions are securely handled and reduces liability.

‚úÖ Data Protection & Privacy
What: Encrypts sensitive data in transit and at rest.

Why it matters: Builds user trust and ensures compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. It is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes to production.

Why It Matters:
CI/CD pipelines help ensure:

‚úÖ Faster development cycles with automated testing and deployment

‚úÖ Higher code quality and fewer bugs in production

‚úÖ Early detection of errors and smoother collaboration

‚úÖ Consistency across different environments

Tools We Use:
GitHub Actions: For automating workflows like running tests, linting, and deploying the application on each push.

Docker: To create consistent, portable development and production environments.

Heroku / AWS / Render / Netlify (depending on stack): For automated deployments to the cloud.

Example Workflow:
Developer pushes code to GitHub.

GitHub Actions runs tests and lints the code.

If tests pass, the app is automatically built and deployed.

CI/CD is an essential part of modern software engineering, ensuring that updates are reliable, repeatable, and delivered quickly.
