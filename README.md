## 🔐 API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure the integrity of the platform.

### ✅ Authentication

* **What**: Verifies user identity via secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens).
* **Why**: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.

### ✅ Authorization

* **What**: Controls access based on user roles.
* **Why**: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they don’t own.

### ✅ Rate Limiting

* **What**: Limits request rates per user/IP.
* **Why**: Protects against brute-force attacks and abuse.

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization

* **What**: Cleans and checks user input before processing.
* **Why**: Prevents SQL injection and XSS attacks.

### ✅ HTTPS / Secure Communication

* **What**: Enforces encrypted connections.
* **Why**: Protects sensitive data during transmission.

### ✅ Secure Payments

* **What**: Uses third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
* **Why**: Ensures secure, PCI-compliant financial transactions.

### ✅ Data Protection & Privacy

* **What**: Encrypts data in transit and at rest.
* **Why**: Builds user trust and supports compliance (e.g., GDPR).

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### 🧠 What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**—automating the process of building, testing, and deploying code.

### 🚀 Why It Matters:

* ✅ Faster development cycles
* ✅ Higher code quality
* ✅ Early bug detection
* ✅ Consistency across environments

### 🧰 Tools We Use:

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates tests, linting, and deployments.
* **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and production environments.
* **Cloud Platforms**: Heroku / AWS / Render / Netlify (based on stack) for automated deployment.

### 🧪 Example Workflow:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs tests and checks
3. If successful, the app is automatically built and deployed

CI/CD is essential for modern engineering—ensuring updates are **reliable, repeatable, and fast**.
